We are Built By Bunkley, LLC (“we”, “us”, or “our”) and we provide a software platform that enables health and fitness businesses to manage operations and provide health and fitness coaching, whether in person or online.
Built By Bunkley’s services include workout and nutrition planning, content scheduling and sharing, messaging (in-app, email, SMS, push), logging personal health records, payment services, and providing tools to help businesses collaborate, get analytics, and grow their business.

We provide our services to:

personal trainers, sport coaches, and/or health professionals that use Built By Bunkley to connect with their clients (Trainers); and
Trainers’ clients that use Built By Bunkley to connect with their Trainers (Clients).

The Privacy Policy applies to both Trainers and Clients, but it is important to distinguish the two as Built By Bunkley’s personal information obligations differ, depending on whether you are a Trainer or a Client.
